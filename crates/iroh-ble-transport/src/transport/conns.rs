//! Index of the live iroh connections riding each BLE pipe, and the
//! close vocabulary the transport uses when it takes a pipe away.
//!
//! Two teardown directions exist and both need this table:
//!
//! - **iroh closes first** — the hook's per-connection `closed()` watcher
//!   fires, and once the last connection on a pipe is gone the transport
//!   drains the pipe. That is what the watch-id bookkeeping here is for.
//! - **the pipe dies first** — dedup eviction, a dead link, an adapter
//!   loss. iroh has no way to learn this on its own: `CustomEndpoint`
//!   cannot report a path as dead, and iroh does not migrate an existing
//!   `Connection` onto a freshly resolved `CustomAddr` (see
//!   `EndpointResolveStream`). A connection whose only path was that pipe
//!   can never carry traffic again, so we close it here rather than
//!   leaving the application blocked on a read until its own deadline.
//!
//! Where the close shows up: the local application — the one whose pipe
//! we took away — sees `ConnectionError::LocallyClosed`, which carries
//! neither code nor reason; what it gains is that its read returns at
//! once instead of hanging. The `(code, reason)` pair below is what the
//! *peer* sees, as `ApplicationClosed`, and what our own logs record.
